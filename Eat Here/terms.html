                <p>(c) Since this App is an information, rating, and user review aggregator that restaurants and users access and utilize under their own volition, we will not be liable for any loss or damage incurred by you when you started using the App, under any circumstances.

If we choose not to enforce any right that we have against you at any time, then this does not prevent us from later deciding to exercise or enforce that right.</p>
